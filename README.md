# Basic-lexer-Python-
This is my attempt to build a compiler in python. It is still in progress.

shell.py -> Simulates the new language syntax. <br/>
basic.py -> Acts as the lexer which tokenize the input string and check whether the user input is valid or not.

I am still learning how to put all the pieces together (e.g. lexer and a parser), so there aren't any advanced features yet.
